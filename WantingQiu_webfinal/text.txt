BIO
  My name is Wanting Qiu. I came frome China. The reason why I take VMD 105 is that this is a requirement for my major. If I had one hour left in my life, I would spend on eating. One of my favortie food is French Fries. I really love food, so all of my class projects are related to food.

RASTER
The final raster project is to create a selfie. Because I really love food, I came up
with the idea of being surrounded by food, and I am eating. The most difficult part was
putting the food in the right position and showed the hirechy.

VECTOR
In the vector project, I created a monster who alway feels hungry. I am not satisfied
with my outcome. Becasue the whole image looks chaotic and messy and the color
of the monster are mess up. If I can improve it, I will change to a simple background. I
might change the color of the Monster, and add stroke too.

MOTION
 I had several ideas before I stated the motion project. But I decided to make fantastic story about a hungry crocodile who is ¡°fighting¡± with the shower head and is fed by it. The biggest challenge is to control and change different parts of crocodile at the
same time.

PRINT
 This project is not really difficult. But it is hard to make it simple but neat. My most favortie part in this project is the quote "IF, FOR THE SAKE OF FOOD AND LIBERTY, I MUST PAY, I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE AWAY."
