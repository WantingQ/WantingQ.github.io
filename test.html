From its humble beginnings more than a century ago, Acme Cola has become an American success story - one that continues to grow daily. Acme was born from the efforts of a young pharmacist in Columbus, Georgia, USA in 1905. After a disagreement with a local soda bottler, Claud A. Hatcher began creating his own soft drinks. Never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined that his experiments would become an American icon affectionately nicknamed Acme Cola.

As one of the original American colas, Acme Cola history is a rich one with many successes over the years with many more to come in the future. Today, consumers enjoy Acme Cola in more than 45 countries worldwide and Acme Cola International products in more than 60 countries. Our products are sold through a global network of more than 100 bottling plants and distributors. These bottlers and distributors are more than just business colleagues - they are our partners; our family. Working together with one common vision and a strong commitment, we share insights into the local markets and inspire each other to grow.
